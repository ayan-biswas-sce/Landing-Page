# Landing Page Project

This project is made to use JavaScript for creating a dynamic Landing page. The web page is divided into various
sections as it would be in a CMS. Each section is differentiated by using css styling when viewing a particular section.
The header of the page is also dynamically created and the active section is highlighted. As soon as someone adds more
sections to the age, automatically the header will possess them.
